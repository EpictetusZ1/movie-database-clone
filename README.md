## Description
An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

The motivation of this project was to re-create a site and some of its functionality from scratch, using the current live version of it as a template.

### Project Planning:

I have attempted to be as thorough as possible in the planning phase of this project. The following is the result of that effort.

Project architecture

*Note:* The project did not adhere to this plan verbatim, however, it provided an incredibly useful map to follow during development and helped me to build a well-structured project.

## Functionality

- Google Authentication
- Persistent "Watch later" list of movies, with ability to add and remove items at will
- A Global (app-level) state management using dynamic data from an API, Redux, and Firebase Firestore
- A Review system that lets any unique user leave a review on a movie to be seen by all others
- Review protection, can only edit review that was written by you
- Dynamically generated data from an API, the site has no data or assets (aside from icons and svgs) of its own

## Things I Learned

- Data Modelling - especially in Firestore with ```Collection / Document / Collection /``` structure
- Redux, and its nuances like how it can be a bit verbose, but does provide incredibly stable application state management
- Dynamic Routes or Routes with parameters. The movie name gets spliced into the URL path on navigation to the movies detail page:
   ```javascript 
   <Route path={"/movie/:title"} element={<MoviePage />} />
  ```
- Client and server side permissions and validations
